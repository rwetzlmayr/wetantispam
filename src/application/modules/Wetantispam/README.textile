h1. Wet Antispam for SocialEngine

*A spam repellent for social networks running SocialEngine PHP 4.*

*Wet Antispam* provides a spam filter for forum posts, messages, activity comments, and blog posts.

Wet Antispam operates invisibly in the background and protects your social network from spammy messages, forum posts, blogs, and activity comments.

User-contributed content is checked by the Akismet spam filtering service.

Wet Antispam rejects spammy contributions and adds an abuse report for the offending member.  It will also add an entry to the Social Engine error log whenever it detects an attempt to create spam content.

It is "free and open source":#legal software.
